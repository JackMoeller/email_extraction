# email_extraction
A Python utility for extracting email addresses from a text file

extract.py takes any text in a .txt document and returns all the email addresses found within it.  I found this useful when someone forwards you an email from someone else and you need to send an email to all the people referenced in the original email.  You can’t just hit reply all because the most recent iteration of the email was just from one person.  You can copy the “to” field (regardless of names or other things that might be in it) and it will spit out just the email addresses for you to copy and paste into a new email.  The utility can be run from the command line with the input file as the first argument.
